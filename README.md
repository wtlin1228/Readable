# React & Redux
Redux excels at state management, and in this course, you'll learn how Redux and React work together to make your application's state bulletproof.

As with the previous course, this is hand-on curriculum, and building projects are what it’s all about. At the end of this course, you’ll leverage React with Redux to build “Readable”, a Reddit clone, as the final project.
